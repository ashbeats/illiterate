# Illiterate Project. 

Create a ui language to convey ideas and sequences of events to even the completely illiterate. Focused on the Asean region for now. 


### Background:

Smartphone pentration in SEA, is at it's highest. However this region is home to a large number illiterate folk. (incl. cambodia, loas). 

By introducing a standard fallback ui language, consumers and producers can effectively communicate through well-designed
mobile ux flows. 

The first instinct is to create a set of icons. But that may be the lowest hanging fruit. 

The final goal is an app that can still be used well, __when all the text is removed.__



#### More research is needed.
